Main aim for this project is to create my own password generator for my daily usage according to my needs.

This is a password generator using javascript and react-library.
Current Features:
set desired password length
include/ exclude numbers, symbols
use lowercase or uppercase or both

Future Features:
make it into web browser extension
add password strength checking and can suggest extra variables for increasing strength

To run it locally:
```
npm create vite@latest
```
```
npm i react-toastify
```
